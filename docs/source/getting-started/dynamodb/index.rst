ScyllaDB is a high-performance NoSQL database designed for low-latency, high-throughput workloads. As a drop-in replacement for DynamoDB and Apache Cassandra, ScyllaDB gives you full control over your data, predictable performance, and dramatically lower costs — without sacrificing scalability. Built on a shard-per-core architecture in C++, ScyllaDB takes full advantage of modern hardware to maximize efficiency.
