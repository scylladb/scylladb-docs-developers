ScyllaDB is a powerful, cost-effective, and flexible alternative to DynamoDB. It offers at least 50% lower cost and lower latency under most workloads. This exceptional price-performance results from a close-to-the-metal architecture and numerous engineering optimizations for performance, elasticity, and efficiency. Another advantage: with ScyllaDB, you can take your DynamoDB workloads beyond AWS and run on any cloud, bare metal, or hybrid.
