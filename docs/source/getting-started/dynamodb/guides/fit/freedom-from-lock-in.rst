ScyllaDB offers developers and organizations a path to avoid vendor lock-in while improving high performance and scalability. By providing compatibility with Apache Cassandra and DynamoDB APIs, ScyllaDB allows teams to transition smoothly from existing deployments without significant code changes.

This also allows users to migrate from the AWS ecosystem onto any other public cloud or their own on-premises datacenters – reducing cost, and improving latency and throughput with minimal to no code changes required.
